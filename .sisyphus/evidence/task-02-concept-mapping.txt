NOTES
================================================================================

1. URL Structure Pattern:
   - All concept pages follow: https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/{category}/{subcategory}
   - Some categories have direct pages: https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/{category}

2. MPT vs IOU Distinction:
   - MPT (Multi-Purpose Tokens) is a subsection of Fungible Tokens
   - IOU/Trust Line Tokens is another subsection of Fungible Tokens
   - Both share the parent: /concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens

3. Escrow Location:
   - Escrow is under payment-types, not tokens
   - URL: /concepts/payment-types/escrow

4. Credentials Location:
   - Credentials is under decentralized-storage, not tokens
   - URL: /concepts/decentralized-storage/credentials
